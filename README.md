# Legacy Algorithm Archive

The Algorithm Archive has moved to a new location: https://algorithm-archivists.github.io/

Please go there for a collaborative book on algorithms written by our community.

As a note: we moved away from gitbook because the platform is transitioning away from the open-source community and is disabling plugins. In order for the Algorithm Archive to work, we need at least 4 functional plugins: `theme-api`, `include-codeblock`, `mathjax`, and `bibtex-cite`. These are not in the new gitbook platform and thus the Algorithm Archive cannot "upgrade" to the new gitbook service. In addition, gitbook is removing the legacy servers in a few months. 

For these reasons, we have moved the community to github pages and are looking for other solutions for long-term maintainence. We have a version of gitbook and all necessary plugins forked to a new algorithm archivists organization, so we should be safe for a bit.

Thanks for supporting the Algorithm Archive so far! I hope to see you at our new location!
